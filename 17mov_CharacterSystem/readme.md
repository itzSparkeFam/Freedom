# HOW TO INSTALL?

When installing on ESX/QBCore, script is drag-drop. It has an auto installation feature, so no configuration is needed. The only step you need to do is remove completly from ur server all previous scripts like:
    - qb-loading
    - qb-multicharacter
    - qb-spawn
    - qb-clothing

    - esx_multicharacter
    - esx_identity
    - esx_skin
    - esx_loadingscreen
    - skinchanger

    - illenium-appearance

Those resources CAN'T be turned on in the same time as our system is. It will generate a lot of problems with skin, overlapping menus etc.
