# Information about Shells for the Housing [props] Package

The **Housing [props]** package in Keymaster already includes the basic shells needed for use in your server. **There is no need to use old shells** that have been previously installed.

### Recommended steps:
- **Remove old shells:** If you have any old shells in your server, it is recommended to remove them to avoid compatibility issues with the new package.
  
### Looking for more shells?
If you are seeking a wider variety of shells, you can join the [K4MB1 Shells Discord](https://discord.gg/k4mb1maps), where you will find over **150 pre-configured shells** available for purchase.

### New! Configurable MLOs for Housing
K4MB1 now also offers **configurable MLOs for housing**, allowing you to further enhance your serverâ€™s housing system with custom interiors and layouts tailored to your needs.

This package is ideal for expanding housing options in your FiveM server.
