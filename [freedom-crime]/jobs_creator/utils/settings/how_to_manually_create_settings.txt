If your server doesn't create current_config.json file automatically, follow these steps:
1. Duplicate the file 'default_config.json' in the same directory
2. Rename the duplicated file to 'current_config.json'
3. Move the 'current_config.json' file to the folder that contains the 'fxmanifest.lua' file of the script
